# <b>TASK-6</b>
<b> Make a mini project on VSD Squadron mini board to understand the board's overview.</b>
# AUTOMATIC LIGHT SYSTEM
An automatic light system is a setup designed to automatically control the lighting based on the presence or absence of individuals within its detection range.
This system will also give the indication of motion detected by blinking the led 3 times.
</br>
<b>COMPONENTS REQUIRED</b>
<ul>VSD SQUADRON MINI BOARD</ul>
<ul>IR SENSOR</ul>
<ul>LEDS</ul>
<ul>BREAD BOARD</ul>
<ul>USB CABLE</ul>
<ul>JUMPER WIRES</ul>
</br>
<b> WORKING </b>
<ul>The IR sensor is strategically placed in a location where it can detect the movement of individuals within its sensing range.
</ul>
<ul>The IR sensor continuously monitors its surroundings for any changes in infrared radiation caused by the movement of individuals.</ul>
<ul>When someone enters the detection range of the IR sensor, it detects the change in radiation and triggers an output signal.</ul>
<ul>When the IR sensor detects motion, it sends a signal to the microcontroller which then activates the LED lighting system.
The LED lights up, providing illumination and the led will blink 3 times in the area where motion is detected which gives indication of motion detected. </ul>
