# <b>TASK-5</b>
<b>Functional simulation experiment using RISC-V Core Verilog netlist and testbench.</b> 

> * **1.IVERILOG:** _Icarus Verilog (IVerilog) is an open-source hardware description language (HDL) simulator.It compiles the Verilog/SystemVerilog code and produces a simulation executable that simulates the behavior of the described hardware._
> * **2.GTKWAVE:-** _GTKWave is a waveform viewer that works in conjunction with simulation tools like Icarus Verilog. It supports various input formats, including VCD (Value Change Dump) files generated by Verilog/SystemVerilog simulators._

First created the verilog file and its testbench file in my github repository and cloned it to the machine using following command.
> * **VERILOG CODE:-** _The code implements a pipelined RV32I processor with basic arithmetic, logic, load/store, and branch instructions.</br>
It supports instructions like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLT, ADDI, SUBI, ANDI, ORI, XORI, LW, SW, BEQ, BNE, SLL, and SRL.</br>
The processor consists of the IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB pipeline stages.</br>
It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, executes them, accesses memory if necessary, and writes back the results.</br>
Branch instructions are supported, with branch conditions evaluated during the execution stage._

```
$  git clone https://github.com/simrangupta29/vsd_squadron_mini_internship
$ cd vsd_squadron_mini_internship
```
Simulate and run the verilog code , using the following commands in terminal.

```
$ iverilog -o vsd_squadron_mini_internship simran_rv32i.v simran_rv32i_tb.v
$ ./vsd_squadron_mini_internship
```

To see the output waveform in gtkwave, enter the following commands in the terminal.
```
$ gtkwave simran_rv32i.vcd
```
