# TASK-1
<b>INSTALLATION OF VIRTUAL BOX AND SETTING UP UBUNTO.</b>

>* We use Oracle VM VirtualBox to run Ubuntu in order to utilize the RISC-V toolchain. The RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) is open-source and widely supported in the Linux environment.

# RISCV-Toolchain

>* The RISC-V toolchain, which includes compilers, assemblers, linkers, and other development tools, is primarily developed and maintained for Linux-based operating systems like Ubunto.

This is the RISC-V C and C++ cross-compiler. It supports two build modes: a generic ELF/Newlib toolchain and a more sophisticated Linux-ELF/glibc toolchain.</br>
These are the commands for installation of riscv Toolchain:-
```
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 python3-pip libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev ninja-build git cmake libglib2.0-dev libslirp-dev
$git clone -- recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain 
$./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv
$ make linux
$ sudo make linux
```

# YOSYS

>* Yosys is an open-source synthesis tool for Verilog RTL (Register Transfer Level) synthesis. It's primarily used for digital synthesis, transforming high-level Verilog code into a netlist of logical gates that represent the desired functionality of a digital circuit.

These are the commands for installation of yosys.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
$ cd yosys
$ sudo apt install make (If make is not installed please install it)
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential clang bison flex
    libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git
    graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev
    libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
$ make config-gcc
$ make 
$ sudo make install
```

# IVERILOG
>*Icarus Verilog (IVerilog) is an open-source hardware description language (HDL) simulator.It compiles the Verilog/SystemVerilog code and produces a simulation executable that simulates the behavior of the described hardware.

These are the commands for installation of iverilog.
```
$sudo apt-get install iverilog
```

# GTKWARE
>* GTKWave is a waveform viewer that works in conjunction with simulation tools like Icarus Verilog. It supports various input formats, including VCD (Value Change Dump) files generated by Verilog/SystemVerilog simulators.

These are the commands for installation of yosys.
```
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install gtkwave
```
