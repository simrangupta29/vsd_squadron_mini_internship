# TASK-2
<b> ABOUT RISC-V ARCHITECTURE </b>

>* RISC-V is an open, versatile instruction-set architecture supporting diverse implementations.</br>
RISC-V is the first widely accepted open-source RISC processor.</br>
It features a base integer ISA, optional extensions, 32/64-bit variants, IEEE-754 floating-point support, and facilitates experimentation with privileged architectures, hypervisors, and parallel computing.

<b> INSTRUCTION SET IN RISCV:- </b>
The RISC-V instruction set is known as RV32I (RISC-V 32-bit integer only) only has 40 instructions. The ISA ( instruction set architecure ) has two sources and one 
destination operands.</br>

<b>RISCV OPERANDS LOCATION</b>
>* **1.REGISTER-** _The fastest and most often used operand is from or to registers on the CPU chip itself. RISC-V RV32I has 32 32-bit registers. 32 registers 
means the instruction must use 3 x 5-bit = 15 bit of the 32-bit instruction._

>* **2.MEMORY-** _The instruction must specify the data memory address, using a register as a pointer._
 
>* **3.CONSTANTS(IMMEDIATES)-** _The third is from instruction memory, i.e. the operand is a constant within  the instruction itself, this is also called an immediate._

<b>The format of the instructions are divided into only six different types</b></br>
</br>
<b>1.R-type (Register/register)</b>:-These are instructions use only registers as source and 
destiantions. This instruction type is mostly used for arithmetic and logic 
operations involving the ALU.</br>

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 | Column 7 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| INSTRUCTION TYPE   |     [25-31]           |  [20-24]  | [15-19]    | [12-14] | [7-11]  | [0-6]     |
| Register  | function7     | rs2     | rs1   | function3     |   rd     |  opcode    |

</br>

 >* opcode (7): partially specifies operation.e.g. R-types have opcode = 0b0110011. </br>
funct7+funct3 (10): combined with opcode, these two fields describe what operation to perform .</br>
rs1 (5): 1st operand (“source register 1”).</br>
rs2 (5): 2nd operand (second source register). </br>
rd (5): “destination register” — receives the result of computation .</br>
 We know that RISCV has 32 registers </br> A 5 bit field can represent exactly 25 = 32 things  
(interpret as the register numbers x0-x31).</br>



<b>2.I-type (Immediate)</b>:-These are instructions has one of the two source operands specified 
within the 32-bit instruction word as a 12-bit constant (or immediate). This 
constant is regards as 12-bit signed 2’s complement number, which is always 
sign extended to form a 32-bit operand</br>.
</br>

| Column 1 | Column 2            | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 |
|----------|---------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|INSTRUCTION TYPE     |        [20-31]         | [15-19]     |  [12-14]    | [7-11]     | [0-6]     |
| Immediates     | imm[11:0]                | rs1      | function3     | rd     | opcode     |

</br>

 >* Opcode (7): uniquely specifies the instruction</br>
 rs1 (5): specifies a register operand</br>
 rd (5): specifies destination register that receives result of computation</br>
 immediate (12): 12 bit number– All computations done in words, so 12-bit immediate must be extended to 32 bits</br>
                              – always sign-extended to 32-bits before use in an arithmetic operation</br>
 imm[11:0] can hold values in range [-211 , +211]</br>
 </br>
 
 <b>3.S-type (Store)</b> :-These instructions are exclusively used for storing contents of a 
register to data memory. </br>


| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 | Column 7 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| INSTRUCTION TYPE   |     [25-31]           |  [20-24]  | [15-19]    | [12-14] | [7-11]  | [0-6]     |
| Register  |  imm[11:5]      | rs2     | rs1   | function3     |   imm[4:0]      |  opcode    |

</br>

>* Store needs to read two registers, rs1 for base memory address, and rs2 for data to be stored, as well as need immediate offset.</br>
 Can’t have both rs2 and immediate in same place as other instructions.</br>
 Note: stores don’t write a value to the register file, no rd!</br>
 RISC-V design decision is move low 5 bits of immediate to where rd field was in other instructions – keep rs1/rs2 fields in same place</br>
 
</br>

<b>4.B-type (Branch):-</b>These instructions are used to control program flow. It compares 
two operands stored in registers and branch to a destination address relative 
to the current Program Counter value. </br>


| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 | Column 6 | Column 7 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| INSTRUCTION TYPE   |     [25-31]           |  [20-24]  | [15-19]    | [12-14] | [7-11]  | [0-6]     |
| Register  |  imm[12] , imm[10:5]      | rs2     | rs1   | function3     |    imm[4:0] ,imm[11]    |  opcode    |

</br>

>*B-format is mostly same as S-Format, with two register sources (rs1/rs2) and a 12-bit immediate</br>
The 12 immediate bits encode even 13-bit signed byte offsets (lowest bit of offset is always zero, so no need to store it</br>
It checks the condition between Rs1 and Rs2,if condition is true:</br>
pc=pc+immediate value(incrementing the pc) and jump to next address based on offset value</br>
if condition is false:</br>
pc=pc+4(which execute next input)</br>

</br>

<b>5.J-type (Jump)</b>:-These instructions are used for subroutine calls.</br>

| Column 1 | Column 2          | Column 3          | Column 4 | Column 5 |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|
|  INST TYPE  | [20-31]               |   [12-19]           |   [7-11]    | [0-6]    |
| U-TYPE    |      imm[20] , imm[10:1] ,imm[11]      |  imm[19:12]            | rd     | Opcode     |

</br>

>* The J-type instruction has instruction like JAL.It encodes 20 bits signed immediate</br>
The address of the desired memory location for jump is defined in the instruction.</br> 
jal saves PC+4 in register rd (the return address)<br>
 Set PC = PC + offset (PC-relative jump<br>
 
</br>
 <b>6.U-type (Upper immediate)</b>:-These instructions are used to specify the upper 20 bits immediate value of a register</br>

| Column 1 | Column 2             | Column 3 | Column 4 |
|----------|----------------------|----------|----------|
|  INST TYPE  | [12:31]                | [7-11 ]    | [0-6]    |
|  U-TYPE   | imm[12:31]                | rd    | opcode    |

>* This instruction should deal with:</br>
-the immediate of 20 bits</br>
-the instruction opcode</br>
-One destination register, rd</br>
 Used for two instructions</br>
 LUI – Load Upper Immediate</br>
AUIPC – Add Upper Immediate to PC</br>

<b>DEBUGGING</b></br>
</br>
spike -d pk sum1ton.o is a command used to simulate the execution of a RISC-V program represented by the binary file sum1ton.o and the proxy kernel, enables debug mode for detailed analysis and debugging.</br>
</br>
> * until pc 0 100b0:_ In the Spike RISC-V simulator,it instructs the simulator to execute instructions until the program counter (pc) reaches the address 100b0._
> * reg 0 a0:_This command is often used during debugging sessions to inspect the state of registers at various points during program execution._
> * lui a0, 0x21:_This instruction loads the immediate value 0x21 into the upper bits of register a0, effectively setting the lower 12 bits to zero.After executing this instruction, register a0 will contain the value 0x0000000021000000_
> * addi sp, sp, -16:_ This instruction subtracts 16 from the stack pointer, effectively allocating 16 bytes of space on the stack.Before executing this instruction, the stack pointer (sp) 0x0000003ffffffb50. After executing addi sp, sp, -16, 16 is subtracted from the value in the stack pointer.Now, the sp has 0x0000003ffffffb40


# <b>TASK-5</b>
<b>Functional simulation experiment using RISC-V Core Verilog netlist and testbench.</b> 

> * **1.IVERILOG:** _Icarus Verilog (IVerilog) is an open-source hardware description language (HDL) simulator.It compiles the Verilog/SystemVerilog code and produces a simulation executable that simulates the behavior of the described hardware._
> * **2.GTKWAVE:-** _GTKWave is a waveform viewer that works in conjunction with simulation tools like Icarus Verilog. It supports various input formats, including VCD (Value Change Dump) files generated by Verilog/SystemVerilog simulators._

First created the verilog file and its testbench file in my github repository and cloned it to the machine using following command.
> * **VERILOG CODE:-** _The code implements a pipelined RV32I processor with basic arithmetic, logic, load/store, and branch instructions.</br>
It supports instructions like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLT, ADDI, SUBI, ANDI, ORI, XORI, LW, SW, BEQ, BNE, SLL, and SRL.</br>
The processor consists of the IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB pipeline stages.</br>
It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, executes them, accesses memory if necessary, and writes back the results.</br>
Branch instructions are supported, with branch conditions evaluated during the execution stage._

```
$  git clone https://github.com/simrangupta29/vsd_squadron_mini_internship
