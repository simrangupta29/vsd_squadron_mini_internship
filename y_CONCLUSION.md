# CONCLUSION
During the VSD Squadron mini Internship, I embarked on a journey exploring various aspects of VLSI system design on the RISC-V architecture, alongside open-source EDA tools.</br> 

<b>Installation and Setup:</b> I began by setting up the development environment, including installing VirtualBox for running Ubuntu and configuring the RISC-V toolchain, Yosys, Icarus Verilog, and GTKWave.</br>

<b>Understanding RISC-V Architecture: </b>I delved into the fundamentals of the RISC-V architecture, learning about its open, versatile instruction set, instruction formats, operand types, and various instruction types and their opcodes.</br>

<b>Lab-Based Tasks:</b> Engaging in lab-based tasks, I wrote and compiled C programs, simulated them using RISC-V GCC compiler and Spike, and analyzed the assembly code. You also performed functional simulation experiments using Verilog netlists and testbenches, utilizing Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.</br>

<b>Spike and Proxy Kernel: </b>I explored the Spike simulator and Proxy Kernel, understanding their roles in simulating RISC-V programs and debugging them effectively.

<b>Mini Project :</b> Automatic Light System: As part of my project work, I implemented an automatic light system using the VSD Squadron mini board,</br> IR sensor, and LEDs, wrote C code to control the system, detecting motion with the IR sensor and indicating it through LED illumination.
